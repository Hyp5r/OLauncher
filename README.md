> From the archives, this was created in 2013 while I was learning more about AHK. This script is not guaranteed to work anymore, but I may resume progress on it. However, this script may not be necessary anymore as well, as Origin has gone through many changes.

> This readme is the archived readme from when I first created this. The only thing that has changed is some redactions.

> The INI included in this script is completely non-standard. At the time, I did not know how to properly parse INI files, but four years later, it's probably one of the easiest things to do in AHK. If I ever get around to messing with this script again, that'll probably be the first fix implemented.

# OLauncher

OLauncher is a script that allows you to launch Origin games from within
the Steam client.  Launching games through this script is automated,
from automatically starting Origin to launching the game that is listed
within the OLauncher.ini file.  Once the game is shutdown, the script
will ask if you would like to keep Origin running or shut it down as
well.

Running Origin games through this script should allow the Steam overlay
to work, though not guaranteed.  However, this is untested with using
both the Steam and Origin overlay, since I personally do not use the
Origin overlay (though this may be tested in the future).

The OLauncher.ini file is preset for Mass Effect 3.  This setup should
tell you how to fill out the INI file, though if you have any questions
on setting up, feel free to email me - [REDACTED]
